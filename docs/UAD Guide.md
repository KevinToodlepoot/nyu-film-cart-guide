# UAD Installation and Setup

While not necessary for the setups, connecting directly to the UAD Apollo Twin interfaces can be a great idea if you want to use the UAD powered plug-ins or if you want to record something from the 1/8th inch jack to your laptop.

Keep in mind that in order to connect to the interface, you must register an account with Universal Audio as well as download ALL of their plug-ins.

## Mac Guide

1. Head to <https://www.uaudio.com/register> and sign up for an account with Universal Audio.
2. If you are using a Mac with Apple Silicon (i.e. an M1 or M2 chip rather than an Intel chip) you will need to start your computer in Recovery Mode to change a system security preference. Follow the instructions on [this page](https://help.uaudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/360057137692-Apple-Silicon-M1-M2-Compatibility-Info?_gl=1*2to8me*_ga*ODk3MjA3MDU0LjE2OTYyNjEyNjI.*_ga_CPJ5176QFT*MTY5Njk1NDQ5NC4yLjEuMTY5Njk1NTQxOS4wLjAuMA..) to do so.
3. Once you have carefully followed the instructions above (or if you are using an Intel Mac) ensure you have a strong internet connection and go to the [Apollo/UAD Downloads Page](https://www.uaudio.com/downloads/uad). Click the blue button labeled *"Download for MacOS"*.
4. Follow the instructions appropriate for your OS to finish installing the UAD Driver:
> - [Mac OS 13 Ventura](https://help.uaudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/10378426500372)
> - [Mac OS 12 Monterey](https://help.uaudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408846715796)
> - [Mac OS 11 Big Sur](https://help.uaudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/360050791811)
5. Open the downloaded .zip file and double click on the .pkg file in the folder to install.
> **Quick Tip**: You do not need to install "UA Connect" unless you would like to use the Universal Audio plugins. To use the Apollo, only the UAD need be installed.
